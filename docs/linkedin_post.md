Especially when accounting for things like **inflation, salary increases (and the progressive tax hit that comes with them!), and then automatically channeling a portion of those net raises back into your savings rate?** I did!

The calculators on Finanzfluss.de are fantastic – simple, useful, and a go-to for many. But I hit a snag: I found myself constantly switching between their Anspar- (accumulation) and Entnahmerechner (withdrawal). I'd experiment with different monthly saving rates and investment durations, see the final amount change, then meticulously copy-paste that new sum into the withdrawal calculator to play with different values there. It became too tedious, and I craved a more dynamic and integrated approach! 😅

So, fueled by that (and maybe a little too much coffee ☕), I decided to build my own solution! Fast forward through what turned out to be **over 6800 lines of HTML (and a whole lot of JavaScript!)**, and I'm thrilled to share my "ETF-Sparplan & Entnahme Rechner."

My goal? To create a more connected and comprehensive financial planning experience, especially tailored for the German context, that models wealth growth with greater realism.

Here's what I packed in:

1️⃣ **Dynamic Accumulation & Seamless Withdrawal:** This was the core! Model your ETF savings growth (Ansparphase) not just with a fixed savings rate, but one that can *dynamically increase* as your salary grows – factoring in the German progressive tax system to determine the *actual net raise* available for reinvestment. Then, seamlessly transition that final capital into the withdrawal phase (Entnahmephase) without the copy-paste dance.

2️⃣ **🇩🇪 Detailed Budget Planner (Haushaltsrechner):** Before you invest, you need to know what you *can* invest. I built a comprehensive budget planner to analyze income and expenses (monthly/yearly), helping you pinpoint your true savings potential. You can even save and load different budget profiles!

3️⃣ **🎯 Accurate German Tax & Salary Calculator (Brutto-Netto Rechner):** Understanding your *actual* net income (and how it changes with raises) is crucial. This module calculates your net salary from gross, fully compliant with 2025 German tax laws – including all social insurances, church tax, and progressive income tax brackets. This also powers the realistic salary increase modeling in the accumulation phase.

This project was a personal challenge, born out of a real need to streamline and enhance my own financial planning. It now allows for:
✅ Calculating net pay accurately.
✅ Detailed budget planning to find extra euros to save.
✅ Modeling ETF growth with dynamic, tax-adjusted salary increases and reinvestment of raises.
✅ Planning retirement withdrawals with German tax considerations.
✅ Comparing multiple investment scenarios side-by-side.
...all in one place, with a focus on real-world financial progression! 🤯

It's amazing what you can build with just some prompts in a couple of days!
